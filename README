To use the Razer Hydra get the SDK from:
http://sixense.com/linuxsdkdownload



~== BUILD ==~

1) create a build directory and go into it:

mkdir x3d-build
cd x3d-build

2) In the build directory use cmake:

$ cmake ../x3d-src

That will use the default settings to interactively change settings (like the sixense SDK directory):

$ cmake -i ../x3d-src

or for a fancier (curses) interface:

$ ccmake ../x3d-src

...remember to press 'c' to configure to be able to see all the settings.

3) Run make will build the project, by default the install directory is a release directory in your build directory, so running make install is safe.

make install

If you want to see the gcc commands when building then enter this before running make:
export VERBOSE=1
