With the announcmenet of xrdesktop, I'm releasing this code as-is for general public use and historic reasons.

What a lot of people may not know is that a lot of the early discussions and development happened on the Meant To be Seen 3D (MTBS3D) forums. Including the Oculus Rift.

* 2012 Apr 15 - Palmer Luckey announced he was going to start a kickstarter for his Oculus Rift prototype. https://www.mtbs3d.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=140&t=14777
* 2012 Jun 9  - Video shared of John Carmack and Rift Prototype. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVDXXfbz3QE
* 2012 Jun 23 - Opened discussions on VR/AR Windows Desktop development shared information on this project. https://www.mtbs3d.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=138&t=15088 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XP0LLfiD43Y https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9EOzPY8R0w
* 2012 Aug 15 - In the same forum druidsbane/hwahba started discussing his implementation of Ibex and sharing code.
* 2012 Aug 18 - In the same forum, a simplified version of this project was released that just did a flat desktop. https://code.google.com/archive/p/vr-x-wrapper https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOVKjM0z3xI

Eventually I will upgrade this project to work with OpenVR, just to make it a functional prototype people can play with in VR.

For newer development on desktop VR/AR the project to follow is xrdesktop:
